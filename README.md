# Rounded_cubes
for Minetest

>One that's rounded on all sides,  
>one with a flat top & bottom, so it's partly cylindrical


GitHub adds  "-master" to the dir name to specify what branch it comes from.  

This suffix isn't needed in Minetest, and unfortunately,  
prevents Minetest from opening the dir,  
because the dash symbol isn't a valid character.  

So after you download, and *unzip* in your **mods** dir,  
**rename it** to simply read "**rounded_cubes**"
